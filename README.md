This is an example of deploying to Helm using GitHub actions.
[View the guide.](https://deliverybot.dev/docs/delivering/helm-action/)

1. Click the "Use this template" button to create a new fork of this repository.

2. Install [deliverybot](https://github.com/apps/deliverybot) on the new repo.

3. Add a `KUBECONFIG` secret into the secrets tab.
